<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>Isn’t this fun?</p>

<% if (action && action == "replace") { %>
  <p>This screen was loaded via a <code>replace</code> action. That replaced the "Page One" view controller that was previously on the top of the navigation stack. Now, going back will take you to the home screen.</p>
<% } else { %>
  <p>This screen was pushed on the navigation stack through an <code>advance</code> action. You can go back to the previous screen by tapping the "< Page One" button.</p>

  <p>Go back and try the <em>replace</em> link to see the difference</p>
